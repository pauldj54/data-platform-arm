Provision a basic data platform in azure using ARM templates

This repo contains an ARM template and its parameter file to provision a simple but powerful data platform in azure using an ARM template. Some other people are already using BICEP, while other prefer Terraform. 

With this approach you can easily provision an environment for POCs or training exercises. 

In this link you can see a video explaining how these files were created and how could be used: (video link)[https://youtu.be/gw0ySBR9r7M]
